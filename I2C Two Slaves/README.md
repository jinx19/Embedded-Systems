# I2C-Protocol
The I2C protocol is used to connect a Master Arduino with two Slave Arduinos. 
A temperature sensor is connected to ones slave and a DC Motor to another.
The Master Arduino retreives the temperature from one slave and depending on the value, the DC Motor is controlled in another slave.
